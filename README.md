## Code snippets:

### Directory structure:

1. Classification: Consists of NLP classification model and
training code, the information about files, file types and 
additional IP has been marked as [REDACTED]. 
    - base_model consists of the model structure
    - text_classification_verticals consists of the training code.
2. Clause separation: Consists of the clause separation algorithm
3. Emotion analysis: Consists of the code for classification of
sentences based on the emotion it contains. It also consists of a similarity based model
that was used to build the dataset out of a corpus consisting of 
unclassified data. 
4. Reinforcement learning: Consists of the reinforcement learning 
final project and project report done last semester. It consists of
two subdirectories of gridworld and mountain car environment and 
the implementation of true online sarsa lambda algorithm on them.
    - gridworld_sarsa is the sarsa lambda algorithm and gridworld_true_online is
   the true online sarsa lambda algorithm implementation
    - mountain_car has the mountain car environment implementation and 
   mountain_car_online_sarsa has the true online sarsa lambda algorithm implementation
